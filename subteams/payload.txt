Payload
"The reason why we're flying."

Payload defines the mission itself, from cameras to data loggers to experimental sensors.
Working on the payload-to-rocket connections so it fits, stays protected, and collects the data we need.
Ensuring it works with Avionics for power and with Airframe for mounting while staying creative about experiments.

Key Skills: Creativity, design integration, data collection, mechanical mounting.
Mission Goal: Build a payload that records flight data and captures video, proving the mission's success.
