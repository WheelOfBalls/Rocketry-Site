Airframe & Structure
"The body that holds it all together."

The main structure of the rocket that everything else depends on.
Designing body tubes, fins, and the nose cone optimized for low drag and high strength.
Making sure every other system fits together perfectly through tight mechanical integration.
Working with CAD and 3D printing to produce flight-ready parts that survive testing.

Key Skills: CAD modeling, material selection, structural design, 3D printing.
Mission Goal: Build a lightweight but durable rocket body capable of handling 10-20g of acceleration with a safe recovery.
