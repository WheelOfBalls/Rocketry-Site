"The power that gets us off the ground."

The heart of the rocket focused on solid motor selection and thrust.
Studying thrust curves, engine performance effects, and how the motor integrates with the airframe.
Ensuring the motor mount and nozzle alignment are precise and safe.
Testing different motor options in OpenRocket and assisting in static firing tests.
Collaborates closely with Airframe to ensure the structure supports the chosen motor.

Key Skills: Simulation, physics, thrust analysis, safety procedures.

Mission Goal: Choose and validate the perfect solid motor for a safe and high-performing flight.
